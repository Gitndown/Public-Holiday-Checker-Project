Public Holiday Checker

MVP

Using the public holiday API: [https://date.nager.at/Api](https://date.nager.at/Api), create a simple console app that allows the user to perform the following tasks:

- view a list of all public holidays for a given country and year
- check if today is a public holiday
- check if a given day was a public holiday. If it was, display the details about that holiday

Remember about error handling!
